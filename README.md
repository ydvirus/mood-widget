# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# This is React Js application build with Vite

Clone the application in your local machine folder -
https://github.com/ydvirus/mood-widget

enter inside mood-widget project
> cd mood-widget

# To run the application follow this steps -

# Install Vite 
1. npm install -D vite

# Install all the dependency
2. npm install OR yarn install

# Run the application locally 
3. npm run dev

Application will start on http://localhost:5173/ port number

We have two tabs, First belong to Mood Widget
Second belongs Date and Time Slot Booking

You will see the button to open the mood widget on first tab.

For Date and Time Slot booking, we have used data from slot.json file available in src\data folder
